# üìù To-Do List Using Streamlit and SQLite

This is a simple, interactive To-Do List application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). The app allows users to manage tasks, set categories, assign priorities, and track task completion status. The data is stored in an SQLite database, allowing for persistent storage between sessions.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Create new tasks with descriptions, categories, and priorities.
- **Task Categories**: Choose from predefined categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Shopping, Other).
- **Task Priorities**: Set task priorities as High, Medium, or Low.
- **Task Status**: Mark tasks as "Completed" or leave them as "Pending." You can toggle task status between these states.
- **Remove a Task**: Easily delete tasks from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Use sidebar filters to filter tasks by category, priority, or status.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are stored in an SQLite database and are retained between sessions.
